LinPeas (Linux Privilege Escalation Audit Script) is a powerful and well-regarded tool used by penetration testers to identify potential privilege escalation vectors on Linux systems. It automates the process of enumerating and checking various aspects of the system that could lead to privilege escalation.

### How LinPeas Works

1. **Enumeration**: LinPeas gathers information about the system, such as user privileges, file permissions, running services, and more.
2. **Checks**: It performs checks on the gathered information to identify misconfigurations, vulnerabilities, and other weaknesses that could be exploited.
3. **Reporting**: LinPeas outputs the results of its checks, highlighting potential privilege escalation vectors.### How LinPeas Works
