* Need to get the flag from the mentioned site.

Site:  http://mercury.picoctf.net:21939/

In this method we can see two HTTP Methods GET and POST0. We can check that 
with Burpsuite.

You can use the following command to get the glag

 curl -I HEAD -i http://mercury.picoctf.net:53554/index.php  --->

Open the Burpsuite and change the GET ----> HEAD and send the request to
