In this PicoCTF we get 2 file
1) static
2) Bash script(ltdis.sh)
This ltdis is a bash script file which is uesed to decrypt the binary files.\

We need to make the ltdis.sh file executable with the following permissions
----------> chmod -x ltdis.sh

We need to pass the "static" file as argument.

This ltdis.sh file automatically decrypts the binary file.

After runnning the bash file we get two output files:
1) static.ltdis.strings.txt
2) static.ltdis.x86_64.txt
You can fild the file in the first file.

Exception:
If the bash file is throwing an error statig that a.out file not found
Just create the file called a.out in the same directory.
