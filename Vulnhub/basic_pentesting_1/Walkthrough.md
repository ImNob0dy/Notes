This is a vulnhub machine called Basic Penetesting 1. This is one of the simplest boxes. 
Gole: Get the root access.

Initially I performed rust and nmap scan.

In that we have 3 open ports "21, 22, 80"

I found port 21 is having a vulnerable version "proftpd 1.3.3"

I found an exploit in metasploit framework.

"unix/ftp/proftpd_133c_backdoor"

After performing this exploit I got the root access.
